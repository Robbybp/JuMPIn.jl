    IncidenceGraphInterface(model; include_inequality = false)

A bipartite incidence graph of JuMP constraints and variables.

This is the primary data type accepted by the algorithms implemented in
the remainder of this module.
This type can be instantiated with a JuMP model or a tuple of
`(graph, con_node_map, var_node_map)`, as returned by
`get_bipartite_incidence_graph`.

Note that the fields of this struct are private, and may change behavior
in a future release without warning.

# Example
```julia
using JuMP
import JuMPIn as ji
m = Model()
@variable(m, v[1:3])
@constraint(m, eq_1, v[1] + v[3]^2 == 1.0)
@NLconstraint(m, eq_2, v[1]*v[2]^1.5 == 2.0)
graph = ji.IncidenceGraphInterface(m)

    dulmage_mendelsohn(igraph::IncidenceGraphInterface)

Return the Dulmage-Mendelsohn partition of variables and constraints
in an incidence graph.

The returned type is a `Tuple` of two `NamedTuple`s, `(con_dmp, var_dmp)`.
These `NamedTuple`s have the following fields:

`con_dmp`:
- `underconstrained` -- The constraints matched with variables that *can
  possibly be* unmatched in a maximum cardinality matching
- `square` -- The constraints that cannot possibly be unmatched in a maximum
  matching
- `overconstrained` -- The constraints that are matched, but *can possibly
  be* unmatched in a maximum matching
- `unmatched` -- The constraints that are not matched in the maximum matching
  that was found

`var_dmp`:
- `unmatched` -- The variables that are not matched in the maximum matching
  that was found
- `underconstrained` -- The variables that *can possibly be* unmatched in a
  maximum matching
- `square` -- The variables that cannot possibly be unmatched in a maximum
  matching
- `overconstrained` -- The variables matched with constraints that *can possibly
  be* unmatched in a maximum cardinality matching

The Dulmage-Mendelsohn partition groups nodes in a bipartite graph into three
unique subsets. In the application to constraints and variables, these may be
thought of as:
- the "overconstrained subsystem", which has more constraints than variables,
- the "underconstrained subsystem", which has more variables than constraints,
- and the "square subsystem", which has the same number of variables as
  constraints

In the `NamedTuple`s returned by this function, the constraints in the
overconstrained subsystem are split into `overconstrained` and `unmatched`,
while the variables in the underconstrained subsystem are split into
`underconstrained` and `unmatched`. This is because it is useful to explicitly
check whether there are any unmatched variables and constraints, and also
useful to recover the maximum matching by `zip`-ing corresponding variables
and constraints.
